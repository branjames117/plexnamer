# plexnamer

This is a script I wrote for my specific file naming situation. For years I had my own personal TV episode naming scheme, which worked perfectly well, until I met Plex, and Plex
told me they wanted everything to be this and that way. So rather than manually go through my entire collection, I wrote a script that should be intelligent enough to rename the
files as Plex sees fit, and ask confirmation from user before pulling the trigger.
